![Phase Shift Runner Preview](assets/images/preview.jpg)

**Phase Shift Runner** is a fast-paced dimension switching arcade runner game where players must survive by shifting between worlds to avoid obstacles.

The game gradually becomes faster, challenging the player's reaction speed and focus.

---

## 🌍 Game Concept

The player exists in two worlds:

- 🔵 Blue Dimension
- 🔴 Red Dimension

Obstacles belong to a specific world.  
If the player stays in the same world as the obstacle, the game ends.

Players must constantly switch dimensions to survive.
